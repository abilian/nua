# Some try for Nua-cli with Typer

For test:


Notes:

-   We need to chose the right CLI framework: `Typer` seems promising.

-   Some draft for commands:

```text
nua init: start new project

nua push: push project (maybe also use git push ?)

nua connect: connect to nua server

nua log -a <appname>

nua start / stop / restart - a <appname>`

nua info -a <appname>

nua server start/stop/restart
```
