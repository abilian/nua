## About

Matomo (formerly known as Piwik) is a free and open-source web analytics platform designed to provide users with information about the visitors to their website. It can track various metrics such as the number of visitors, pageviews, bounce rate, average visit duration, and many more.

Matomo offers features such as real-time tracking, custom reporting, heat maps, A/B testing, and conversion tracking, which can help website owners optimize their site for better user engagement and conversions. It also prioritizes user privacy by allowing website owners to host their own data on their servers, ensuring that sensitive user data is kept private and secure.

Matomo is a popular alternative to Google Analytics and other proprietary web analytics platforms, particularly for those who value data privacy and ownership.

Matomo was created by Matthieu Aubry in 2007 while he was a student in France. Aubry was dissatisfied with existing web analytics solutions and wanted to create an open-source alternative that prioritized user privacy and gave website owners full control over their data. Since then, Matomo has grown to become one of the most popular web analytics platforms in the world, with millions of downloads and users in over 190 countries. In 2018, Matomo was renamed from Piwik to Matomo to better reflect its mission of empowering individuals and organizations to take control of their data.
