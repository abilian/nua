# Synapse

## About

Synapse is a popular Matrix homeserver implementation written in Python. It allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through the decentralized Matrix network, which provides a secure and open alternative to traditional messaging platforms.

As a homeserver, Synapse is responsible for storing and forwarding messages between Matrix clients. It offers many features such as end-to-end encryption, multi-device synchronization, bridging with other chat protocols, and more.

Synapse is distributed under the Apache License 2.0 and is actively developed and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation and its community. It has become the reference implementation for the Matrix protocol, and many popular Matrix clients, such as Riot.im, use Synapse as their default homeserver.
