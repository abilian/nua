Testing:

-   we use the feature of no build.py but project auto detection
-   also tested: automatic name for bind network
-   also tested: meta package with alias name 'postgres-client'
-   DB resource is defined directly with tag "docker" and explicit docker image. Not the prefered way, but should still work.
