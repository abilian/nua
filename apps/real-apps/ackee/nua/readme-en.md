## About

Ackee is an open-source web analytics software that allows website owners to track and analyze visitor behavior on their sites. It is developed by [Tobias Reich](https://electerious.com/imprint), a German developer, and is released under the MIT license.

Ackee provides various features to help website owners understand how their visitors interact with their content, such as page views, unique visitors, referrers, user agents, and geographic locations. It also supports event tracking, which allows website owners to track custom events, such as button clicks, form submissions, and video plays.

Ackee is designed with privacy in mind and does not use cookies or collect any personally identifiable information about visitors. It also provides a self-hosted solution, which means that website owners have full control over their data and can comply with data protection regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Ackee is written in JavaScript and can be integrated into websites through a JavaScript snippet or a plugin for popular content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal. It stores data in a MongoDB database and provides a web-based user interface for analyzing the data.
