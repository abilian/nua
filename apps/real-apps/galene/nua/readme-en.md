# Galene

## About

Galene is a free, open-source video conferencing and streaming server software that allows users to host their own video conferences and live streaming events. It is designed to be lightweight, low-latency, and easy to set up, making it ideal for small to medium-sized online meetings or events.

Galene uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology, which is built into modern web browsers, to establish peer-to-peer connections between participants in a video conference or live stream. This allows for low-latency communication and a high-quality audio and video experience, even with a large number of participants.

One of the key features of Galene is its support for end-to-end encryption, which helps ensure that communication between participants is private and secure. It also supports various video and audio codecs, allowing users to choose the best quality for their specific needs.

Galene is open-source software, which means that it can be freely downloaded, modified, and distributed by anyone. It is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems, and can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud. It is developed by [Juliusz Chroboczek](https://www.irif.fr/~jch/), a researcher at the Sorbonne Université, with financial support from [Nexedi](https://www.nexedi.com/).

Galène has been used in production at two major universities (Université de Paris and Sorbonne Université) for lectures, practicals, seminars, and for staff meetings. It has been used to host several conferences.
