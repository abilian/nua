# Etherpad Lite

## About

Etherpad Lite is a free, open-source, collaborative online text editor that allows multiple users to work on the same document in real-time. It was developed by the [Etherpad Foundation](https://etherpad.org/) and is written in JavaScript and Node.js.

Etherpad Lite allows users to create and edit documents online, and collaborate with others by sharing the document's URL. The editor provides a simple, distraction-free interface with basic formatting options, such as bold, italic, and underline. Users can also insert images, links, and tables into the document.

One of the key features of Etherpad Lite is its ability to show changes made by each user in real-time, allowing for easy collaboration and coordination. It also supports version control, so users can easily revert to earlier versions of the document if needed.

Etherpad Lite is designed to be easily self-hosted, which means that anyone can download and install it on their own server. It can also be integrated with other applications, such as chat clients, project management tools, and content management systems.

Etherpad Lite has become popular among developers, writers, and educators who need a simple, collaborative writing tool. It has been used for various purposes, including collaborative note-taking, meeting minutes, writing workshops, and remote education.
