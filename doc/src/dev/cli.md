## Color output

Please respect the following conventions for color output:

- red: only for errors or serious warnings
- orange: for recoverable warnings
- blue: when we're about to start something important
- green: when it's done (i.e. for success messages)
- black: for normal messages
- gray: for debug messages (that are not supposed to be read, unless something goes wrong or takes too much time)
