# Code of Conduct

We expect contributors to our projects and online spaces to follow [the Python Software Foundationâ€™s Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/).

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community.

## Our Community

Members of the Python community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
* **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

## Inappropriate Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment of any participants in any form
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
* Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks
* Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule
* Excessive swearing
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Enforcement

We take Code of Conduct violations seriously, and will act to ensure our spaces are welcoming, inclusive, and professional environments to communicate in.

If you need to raise a Code of Conduct report, you may do so privately by email to tom@tomchristie.com.

Reports will be treated confidentially.

Alternately you may [make a report to the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/reporting/).
